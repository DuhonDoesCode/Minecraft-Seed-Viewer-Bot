# Setup

If you want to run this bot yourself, great! Please start by downloading the latest version of Python and then discord.py:

`pip install discord.py`

Then go to https://github.com/hube12/Minemap and download the latest release (specifically the .jar) and then rename it to just **MineMap.jar**. Place it in the same folder as **bot.py**.
