# Minecraft-Seed-Viewer-Bot

!!! This bot is currently being developed in the early stages and thus is not very useful. !!!

# Examples

![Command Example](readme/example1.png)

This is an example command on the bot. After a few moments, it'll fetch the rendered version of this seed.

![Command Result](readme/example2.png)

![Stronghold and Structure finder](readme/example3.png)

It also finds you a seed with a specific structure at spawn, and that seed's estimated stronghold location.

# Setup

If you want to run this bot yourself, great! Please start by downloading the latest version of Python and then discord.py:

`pip install discord.py`

Then go to https://github.com/hube12/Minemap and download the latest release (specifically the .jar) and then rename it to just **MineMap.jar**. Place it in the same folder as **bot.py**.

**If not running on Windows, do the following:**
Go to the "cubiomes files" folder inside of "release" and then follow the compilation instructions text file, since I compiled my .out's in a Windows machine they do NOT work on Linux or Mac.
