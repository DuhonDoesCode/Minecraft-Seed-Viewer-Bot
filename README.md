# Minecraft-Seed-Viewer-Bot

!!! This bot is currently being developed in the early stages and thus is not very useful. !!!

# Examples

![Command Example](readme/example1.png)

This is an example command on the bot. After a few moments (30-ish seconds for a first time, then its speedy), it'll fetch the rendered version of this seed.

# Setup

If you want to run this bot yourself, great! Please start by downloading the latest version of Python, then in the cmd install discord.py and selenium with the following commands:

`pip install discord.py`
`pip install selenium`

Note: You'll need to have Mozilla Firefox installed since that's the webdriver used for the bot!

After that, run the bot and you'll see Firefox open. **Keep that tab in focus at all times** as every time a command is used it'll scrape info from it! Without it being in focus, it will just stall out the bot.
